  const aboutMeData = "I'm a dedicated and passionate developer with a strong foundation in JavaScript, Android app development, and full-stack web technologies. With professional experience at Infosys as a Senior Systems Engineer, I've worked across high-impact projects involving application support, server management, and modern development frameworks. Currently, I'm focused on front-end development, where I combine design thinking with technical expertise to build user-friendly, responsive interfaces. I enjoy crafting seamless digital experiences that not only function well but also look great. Beyond coding, photography is my creative escape. I love capturing moments through the lens and bringing them to life with thoughtful editing. Whether it's building elegant UI or editing a perfect shot, I'm always driven by creativity, precision, and passion. Since starting my journey in tech in 2017, I've continuously embraced new challengesâ€”from Android apps and neural networks to cloud-based tools like Azure and Power BI. I believe in learning by doing and turning ideas into meaningful, real-world solutions."
